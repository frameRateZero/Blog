## You've Landed at the FrameRate(0) Blog

This blog compliments my generative art zine by the same name -- FrameRate(0).

The goals are to:
1. Turn code into physical, non-screen based art objects.
        a. Turn physical objects into screen-based ephemera. Goto #1.
3. Make art and explore what that even means nowadays.
4. Give back -- pay forward -- what I've learned.
