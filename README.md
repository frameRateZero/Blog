## You've Landed at the FrameRate(0) Blog

This blog compliments my generative art zine by the same name -- FrameRate(0).

Motivations:
1. Turn code into physical, non-screen based art objects.
   1. Turn physical objects into screen-based ephemera. Goto #1.
1. Make art and explore what that even means nowadays.
1. Give back -- pay forward -- what I've learned.
