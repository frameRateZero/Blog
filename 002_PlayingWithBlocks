#Playing With Blocks

Baby steps are trial and error. My first generative art frameRate(0) zine (Jan 2020) fell down a lot. Partly because it was my ["Hello World"](), and mostly because it was an homage to George Nees and his classic work Schotter.

There are many reproductions and many derivatives of Schotter because it is visually compelling, understandable, simple. The algorithm draws 12 columns and 22 rows of squares. Progressively by row, the rotation and "jitter" or offset applied to the square increases. One interpretation of Schotter is that it shows "the relationship between order and disorder, and the effects of change."<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> I go into much more detail about Schotter another [post](). 

The combination of the grid and use of a square is so simple yet rich with possibility. The beautiful book "10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10"<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> illustrates the this concept through pages of graphics. It offers a defense of the grid saying:

>"...the structure of the grid is what makes it possible to focus on the variability created through random operations." <sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

The sharpest critism of the grid was laid out in depth in Rosaline Krauss' 1979 essay "Grids".

>...the grid announces, among other things, modern art's will to silence, its hostility to literature, to narrative, to discourse. The arts, of course, have paid dearly for this success, because the fortress they constructed on the foundation of the grid has increasingly become a ghetto... It is not just the sheer number of careers that have been devoted to the exploration of the grid that is impressive, but the fact that never could exploration have chosen less fertile ground...and modernist practice continues to generate ever more instances of grids. â€“ Rosaline Krauss (1979), Grids <sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>
